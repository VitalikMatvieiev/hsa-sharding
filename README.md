I got some issues when I try to insert the data:
```
ERROR:  could not connect to server "books_1_server"
DETAIL:  connection to server at "127.0.0.1", port 5514 failed: Connection refused
	Is the server running on that host and accepting TCP/IP connections?
SQL state: 08001
```

But I got general idea of sharding, I have not worked with it before
